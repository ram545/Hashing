# Hashing
Write a program to find duplicate characters in a string in least time. Display their frequency of occurrences too. Avoid using 2 nested for/while loops.

Given a string, generate a hash table to track all occurrences of   words (delimited by space or tab), their positions, and frequency of occurrences.
